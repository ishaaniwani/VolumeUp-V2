I built my code on top of gkonovalov's [android-vad](https://github.com/gkonovalov/android-vad) project.

MainActivity, VoiceRecorder, and Pop java classes are main classes, plus the layout resource files.

I also used Armen101's [AudioRecordView project](https://github.com/Armen101/AudioRecordView) as a framework for graphing amplitudes.
